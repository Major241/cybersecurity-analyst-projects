# First Project: Suspicious Login (Practice)
**25 August 2025 | Level: Beginner**

## Situation
I simulated a scenario involving a suspicious login attempt on a computer system.

## Steps I Took
1. I imagined there were multiple failed login attempts with wrong passwords.
2. I then imagined a subsequent login attempt that was successful.

## Result
This pattern of activity could indicate a brute-force attack, where an attacker uses multiple password guesses to gain access.

## If This Were Real, I Would:
- Immediately reset the password for the compromised account.
- Alert the organization's security incident response team.
- Work with the team to review access logs for further malicious activity.
