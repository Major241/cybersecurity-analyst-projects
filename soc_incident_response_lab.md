# SOC Incident Response Lab

A collection of hands-on, fictional SOC alert investigations. This lab simulates the end-to-end process of responding to security incidents following the NIST IR lifecycle, from initial alert to containment and eradication.

## üö® Lab Overview

This project demonstrates the analytical process of a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst by responding to realistic security alerts. For each incident, I act as the analyst, requesting data from simulated sources to triage, investigate, contain, and resolve the threat.

**Key Skills Practiced:**
- **Incident Triage & Analysis**
- **Digital Forensics & Evidence Collection**
- **Threat Intelligence Correlation**
- **Containment & Eradication Strategy**
- **Documentation & Ticketing**

## üîç Lab Structure

Each lab is contained in its own directory and includes:
- `alert.md`: The initial SIEM alert that triggered the investigation.
- `investigation.md`: The step-by-step investigation process, including my queries and the simulated data responses.
- `ticket.md`: The final incident ticket, documenting the timeline, findings, and resolution.

## üìÇ Incident 1: Brute Force Attack on Privileged Service Account

**Alert:** `HV001: Suspicious Volume of Failed Logins - Potential Brute Force`
**Summary:** An alert triggered for 32 failed login attempts to a VPN service account (`svc_jenkins`) followed by one success from a known malicious IP.

### Investigation Highlights:
- **Triage:** Verified the user was a privileged service account with outdated credentials.
- **Threat Intel:** Confirmed the source IP was associated with bulletproof hosting and malicious activity.
- **Impact Analysis:** Discovered an outbound C2 connection and ~15MB of data exfiltration post-compromise.
- **Response:** Contained the threat by disabling the account and blocking the IP, then eradicated by enforcing password policies and implementing VPN MFA.

**Key Takeaway:** The critical importance of MFA for all remote access and strict password policies for service accounts.

## üìÇ Incident 2: Web Server Compromise via LOLBins

**Alert:** `EXEC-ALERT-007: Execution of LOLBin followed by Network Call`
**Summary:** A critical alert detected the execution of `certutil.exe` by a web service account (`iis_service`) to download a file from a malicious domain.

### Investigation Highlights:
- **Triage:** Identified the account as a service account with web server permissions.
- **Threat Intel:** Confirmed the destination domain was a known malware distribution site.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Correlated the event with IIS logs to find a successful WordPress plugin exploit.
- **Response:** Contained the host immediately, eradicated the downloaded malware, and initiated patching for the web application vulnerability.

**Key Takeaway:** The necessity of robust web application security and the ability to recognize Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLBins) in attacker workflows.

## üìÇ Incident 3: Phishing & Credential Harvesting Attempt

**Alert:** `EMAIL-ALERT-101: Suspected Phishing Email Delivered to Mailbox`
**Summary:** A high-severity alert for a phishing email with a malicious link, sent to a high-value helpdesk account.

### Investigation Highlights:
- **Triage:** Analyzed sender domain and confirmed spoofing indicators (new domain, no DMARC).
- **Breach Check:** Discovered the target account had a weak, compromised password.
- **Response:** Purged the malicious email from all mailboxes and enforced a password reset for the vulnerable account.

**Key Takeaway:** Proactive credential hygiene is as important as detecting the initial phishing email.

## üöÄ How to Use This Lab

1.  Review the `alert.md` for a specific incident.
2.  Read the `investigation.md` and think about what your next query would be before reading my action.
3.  Compare your thought process with my investigation path.
4.  Review the completed ticket in `ticket.md` to see the full documentation.

## ‚úÖ Purpose

This lab was created to practice and demonstrate the core analytical skills required in SOC incident response. The simulated environment allows for focus on the investigative process and decision-making without the need for a complex lab setup.
