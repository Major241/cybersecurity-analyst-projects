 First Project: Suspicious Login (Practice)
 25 August 2025   Level: Beginner  
        Situation
 I pretended there was a suspicious login attempt on a computer.
        Steps I Took
 I imagined there were 3 wrong password attempts.  
 Then the login was successful.  
 I wrote down what this might mean.  

        Result
This could be a brute-force attack.  

If this were real, I would:  
- Reset the password  
- Alert the security team
