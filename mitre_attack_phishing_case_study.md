ðŸŽ¯ **Case Study: Deconstructing a Phishing Attack with MITRE ATT&CK**

ðŸ”¹ **Objective**

Simulate a phishing email attack, collect forensic evidence, and map the adversary behaviors to the MITRE ATT&CK framework using real-world techniques.

---

ðŸ”¹ **Investigation Steps**

	1.	Setup & Simulation

	â€¢	Generated a trackable phishing URL with Canarytokens.

	â€¢	Crafted a phishing email and executed a controlled click to trigger an alert.

	â€¢	![canarytokens](Canarytokens interface showing the generated URL)

	2.	Evidence Collection

	â€¢	Captured timestamp, IP address, and browser details from the triggered beacon.

	â€¢	Validated adversary behavior using forensic logs.

	â€¢	ðŸ“¸ Screenshot: Alert output (IP, timestamp, browser).

	3.	ATT&CK Mapping

	â€¢	Resource Development â†’ T1583 (Acquire Infrastructure)

	â€¢	Initial Access â†’ T1566.002 (Phishing: Spearphishing Link)

	â€¢	Execution â†’ T1204.001 (User Execution: Malicious Link)

	â€¢	Command & Control â†’ T1102 (Web Service)

	â€¢	Collection â†’ T1114 (Email Collection)

	â€¢	Impact â†’ T1498 (Network Denial of Service)

	â€¢	ðŸ“¸ Screenshot: ATT&CK Navigator showing highlighted techniques.

	4.	Visualization

	â€¢	Created a flow diagram of the phishing lifecycle.

	â€¢	Email â†’ Malicious Link â†’ User Click â†’ C2 Beacon â†’ Data Collection

ðŸ”¹ **Outcome**

This project transformed a theoretical framework into a hands-on investigative workflow. By simulating a phishing lifecycle and mapping each step to MITRE ATT&CK, I demonstrated how analysts can:

	â€¢	Translate raw evidence into standardized threat language.

	â€¢	Visualize adversary behavior across the kill chain.

	â€¢	Use ATT&CK to guide hunting and strengthen SOC defenses.
