### **ðŸŽ¯ Case Study: Deconstructing a Phishing Attack with MITRE ATT&CK**

#### ðŸ”¹ Objective
Simulate a phishing email attack, collect forensic evidence, and map the adversary behaviors to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Tools Used
*   **Canarytokens:** Generated trackable URL and captured forensic data.
*   **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator:** Mapped techniques to the framework.
*   **Browser & Email Client:** Simulated user interaction.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Investigation Steps

**1. Setup & Simulation**
*   Generated a trackable phishing URL using Canarytokens.
*   Crafted a phishing email and executed a controlled click to trigger the alert.
*   `[Screenshot: Canarytoken Generation]($image_link_1)`

**2. Evidence Collection**
*   Captured timestamp, source IP, and user-agent data from the alert.
*   `[Screenshot: Forensic Alert Data]($image_link_2)`

**3. ATT&CK Mapping**
Mapped the attack lifecycle to the following techniques:
*   **Resource Development:** T1583 (Acquire Infrastructure)
*   **Initial Access:** T1566.002 (Spearphishing Link)
*   **Execution:** T1204.002 (User Execution)
*   **Command & Control:** T1102 (Web Service)
*   **Collection:** T1114.003 (Email Collection)
*   **Impact:** T1498 (Network Denial of Service)
*   `[Screenshot: ATT&CK Navigator Layer]($image_link_3)`

**4. Visualization**
*   Documented the attack flow: `Email â†’ Malicious Link â†’ User Click â†’ C2 Beacon â†’ Data Collection`

#### ðŸ”¹ Outcome
This project transformed MITRE ATT&CK from theory into practice. By simulating an attack and mapping it to the framework, I demonstrated how to:
*   Translate evidence into standardized threat language.
*   Visualize adversary behavior across the kill chain.
*   Use ATT&CK to guide detection engineering and threat hunting.
