# **Shodan Reconnaissance Methodology**

### **Introduction**
Shodan.io is a search engine for Internet-connected devices. Unlike traditional search engines that index web content, Shodan scans the internet and catalogs the banners and metadata of any device with a public IP address. This makes it a critical tool for cybersecurity professionals to discover, analyze, and monitor an organization's external attack surface.

### **Objective**
This report outlines a standard methodology for using Shodan to perform defensive security reconnaissance, using a **public Google server as a case study**. The primary goals are to:
*   Demonstrate the end-to-end process of discovering and analyzing internet-facing assets.
*   Identify open ports and services running on a target system.
*   Assess the security posture of a device based on its public exposure.
*   Highlight the value of Shodan for proactive defense.

### **Investigation Steps & Case Study**
The following steps form a core reconnaissance workflow, illustrated by a practical example:

1.  **Target Identification:** Acquire a target IP address.
    *   *Case Study: The domain `google.com` was resolved to the IP address `142.251.16.103` using supporting tools.*

2.  **Shodan Query:** Input the target IP address into the Shodan search engine.
    *   *Case Study: The IP `142.251.16.103` was queried in Shodan.*

3.  **Data Analysis:** Examine the detailed host report generated by Shodan.
    *   *Case Study: The Shodan report for `142.251.16.103` was analyzed, focusing on open ports and banners.*

### **Outcome: Case Study Results**
The Shodan scan of the case study target (`142.251.16.103`) returned the following results:
*   **Open Ports:** The scan revealed only two open ports:
    *   **Port 80 (HTTP):** Configured solely to redirect traffic to HTTPS via a `301 Moved Permanently` status code.
    *   **Port 443 (HTTPS):** The secure port serving encrypted web traffic.
*   **Security Assessment:** This configuration is highly secure. The system exhibits a minimal attack surface, having eliminated unnecessary services and exposure of administrative ports (e.g., SSH-22, FTP-21). This aligns with security best practices and demonstrates an ideal, hardened external posture.

### **Why This Methodology Matters to Analysts**
This process is fundamental to modern cybersecurity operations because it allows analysts to:
*   **Discover Unknown Assets:** Identify forgotten, unmanaged, or unauthorized devices on a network (shadow IT).
*   **Perform Proactive Hardening:** Find and remediate misconfigured services (e.g., databases, admin interfaces) before they can be exploited.
*   **Manage Vulnerability Exposure:** Quickly determine if assets vulnerable to a new CVE are exposed to the public internet.
*   **Assess Third-Party Risk:** Evaluate the external security posture of vendors and partners.

### **Tools Used**
*   **Primary Tool:** Shodan.io (For primary reconnaissance and scanning)
*   **Supporting Tools:** Command-line utilities (`ping`, `nslookup`) and other OSINT platforms (e.g., `urlscan.io`) can be used for initial target discovery and verification.

### **Ethical Concerns & Legal Considerations**
Shodan accesses only publicly available information. However, its power demands strict ethical use:
*   **Authorization is Mandatory:** This methodology must only be applied to assets you own or have explicit, written permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal.
*   **Reconnaissance, Not Intrusion:** Shodan is for information gathering. It must not be used to attempt access, exploit vulnerabilities, or disrupt services.
*   **Responsible Disclosure:** Findings related to your own organization must be reported through proper internal channels for remediation.

### **Conclusion**
Shodan is an unparalleled tool for external attack surface management. The methodology outlined—from target identification to security assessment—provides a blueprint for proactive defense, as demonstrated by the case study. By continuously monitoring their digital footprint, organizations can shift from a reactive security stance to a proactive one, significantly reducing their risk of a breach. Mastering Shodan reconnaissance is a critical skill for any cybersecurity analyst.
